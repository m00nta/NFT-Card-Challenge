## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned so much on this project even it's a small one but it took me longer than I thought it would. Mainly I learned how to rely on myself and how to do some research and look for insight.

Unfortunetly I didn't use git I just uploaded the project to the github repository directly but I intend to learn GIT commands in future challanges and projects
